  This paper aims to analyze the changes in research paper output for different statistical and computational fields over the time period from the 1990s to modern day (2025). The paper also projects short term growth for recently emerging fields in an effort to predict the fields that will receive further resource funding and attention in the near future. The research papers used for this analysis are sourced from a dataset of papers from the pre-print journal arXiv.

## Introduction {#sec-intro}

In recent years, with the fields of artifical intelligence and machine learning becoming important parts of the public lexicon and increasingly becoming involved in our day to day lives, we've seen firsthand large changes in statistical and computational research. With statistical methods increasingly becoming intertwined with computational principles, such as its integration with aspects of computer science, the future of statistics and computation appear to be one and the same. How does this current research landscape compare with that of the landscape a mere 30 years ago? This paper aims to analyze historical trends in statistical and computational research, as tracked by papers submitted to the online pre-print journal arXiv, in order to visualize the dramatic changes we've seen over the years and find any subfields growing in the present that could yet transform the landscape of the future. This analysis of historical trends will be conducted using a specific dataset available on Kaggle @arXiv:kaggle:data.

## Literature Review {#lit-review}

Looking at themes in statistical and computational research is nothing new. For instance, @gelm:veht:2021 analyzed the dominant statistical ideas of the past 50 years, suggesting inferential methods, computational algorithms, and data nalysis have been the most impactful in the shifting of the research landscape. Smaller subsets of time have also been analyzed, with @jun:yoo:choi:2018 using Google Trends to track the growth of different subfields of research (with an emphasis on big data and application). This paper aims to look at a similar problem with a different lens, using publication outputs themselves as a way of analyzing changes in research focus and interest. In doing this, the paper aims to also obtain an indication of the subfields with increasing research interest in the short term that may lend itself to future publications. Evaluating the research trends of the future has often involved modeling itself, such as the hype cycle model @dedehayir:2016. This model aims to track the life cycle of technological innovations. In a similar vein, this paper aims to use current and recent paper production output to indicate trends of the near future. As the methodology involves using the research paper pre-prints themselves, it may provide a clearer picture of specific publication interests and trends rather than topics and concepts in general.

## Research Questions {#sec-questions}

-   What statistical and computational fields have seen the largest increase in publications?
-   How have the most published statistical and computational fields changed over time?
-   What statistical and computational fields are projected to grow the most in the coming years?

## Data {#sec-data}

### Data Description

The arXiv paper dataset consists of 136,238 observations and 10 columns. The 10 columns present in the data are: id, title, category, category code, published date, updated date, authors, first author, summary, and summary word count. Only the summary word count is a numeric variable. This data is scraped directly from arXiv, aiming to provide a representative sample of research published on the platform.

### Data Pre-Processing

The original dataset will have its variables converted to categorical variables for grouping and analytical purposes, with the exception of the summary word count due to its numeric nature. Following this, two selected lists of subtopics will be created for the purpose of data partitioning and separate analysis.

### Data Partitioning

While acknowledging the connected nature of statistical and computational research in the present and future, this paper will partition the data into two halves. One half will be comprised of research deemed statistical in nature, and the other half will be comprised of research deemed as computational. This split in the data is done to narrow down the problem and allow for ease of analysis and interpretation of the results. Along with this, the data will also be subset in terms of time. In order to keep each yearly subset of papers as a representative sample of all research output for that year, the time range will be limited to exclude publication in 2025. This is done so that the resulting analysis will focus on comparison with full yearly samples of research data, rather than extrapolating from the research output in the year 2025 as of now.

## Methods {#sec-meth}

### Quantifying growth

For the purposes of this paper, growth will be represented by two metrics. Firstly, the simple percentage change from year to year for each subfield will be considered. In addition to this, the proportion of overall research represented by each subfield over time will also be used to evaluate growth in research interest and output.

### Trend analysis and short-term prediction

Lastly, the metrics of growth as well as the partitioned data will be used to create a prediction model for the short term growth of research subfields. In correspondence with the data partitioning, separate models will be constructed for the statistical research and the computational research. The objective here is to produce a time series model for short term projections of growth in research interests and outputs.

### Limitations

Focusing on primarily numerical data as a sign of growth indicates a relatively simple way of quantifying growth. In reality, growth is a more complex idea and could benefit from the use of paper content for text data processing to supplement the numerical figures of growth. This is a potential avenue of further exploration and work.

## Results {#sec-results}

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Original Data

Before examining each partition of the original data for the purpose of directly answering the research questions, it is important to understand the context behind and the general appearance of the original dataset itself. For this reason, many plots were created to visualize parts of the data during the data pre-processing and data partitioning stages.

![Artifical Intelligence Paper Output Plot](images/ai_plot.png)

This initial plot of the research paper outputs for the category of Artifical Intelligence indicates several patterns we will continue to see in this data. Though Artifical Intelligence is often seen as a recent breakthrough that has only gotten larger year by year, we can see here that the yearly trend is far from consistent.

From here, we then further explore each of the partitioned datasets rather than focusing on the original alone, as these will be the foundation of our future analysis and modeling.

#### Statistical Data

The statistical data subset is comprised of the topics Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability, Machine Learning (Statistics), Methodology (Statistics), Computation (Statistics), Other Statistics, Applications (Statistics), and Statistics Theory. In order to explore the relative frequencies of paper output by these topics, we present an initial plot of this data.

![Statistical Data Paper Output Plot](images/stat_edaplot-2.png)

From this initial plot it is immediately apparent that Machine Learning (Statistics) and Methodology appear to be the most popular subdomains, with other subdomains varying and not having a clear edge over each other. This provides us with a general impression of the data prior to delving into the specific yearly figures and relative frequencies.

## Verifications {#sec-verify}

This section will be just long enough to illustrate what a full page of text looks like, for margins and spacing.

@gelm:veht:2021 offer some guidance about key ideas about statistical ideas. On an unrelated note, spreadsheets are important to use correctly [@brom:woo:2018]. Log-linear models are an attractive way to model categorical data [@bish:fien:1975].
