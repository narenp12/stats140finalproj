abstract = {The hype cycle model traces the evolution of technological innovations as they pass through successive stages pronounced by the peak, disappointment, and recovery of expectations. Since its introduction by Gartner nearly two decades ago, the model has received growing interest from practitioners, and more recently from scholars. Given the model's proclaimed capacity to forecast technological development, an important consideration for organizations in formulating marketing strategies, this paper provides a critical review of the hype cycle model by seeking evidence from Gartner's own technology databases for the manifestation of hype cycles. The results of our empirical work show incongruences connected with the reports of Gartner, which motivates us to consider possible future directions, whereby the notion of hype or hyped dynamics (though not necessarily the hype cycle model itself) can be captured in existing life cycle models through the identification of peak, disappointment, and recovery patterns.}

abstract = {This study seeks to analyze the trends in research studies in the past decade which have utilized Google Trends, a new source of big data, to examine how the scope of research has expanded. Our purpose is to conduct a comprehensive and objective research into how the public use of Big Data from web searches has affected research, and furthermore, to discuss the implications of Google Trends in terms of Big Data utilization and application. To this end, we conducted a network analysis on 657 research papers that used Google Trends. We also identified the important nodes of the networks and reviewed the research directions of representative papers. The study reveals that Google Trends is used to analyze various variables in a wide range of areas, including IT, communications, medicine, health, business and economics. In addition, this study shows that research using Google Trends has increased dramatically in the last decade, and in the process, the focus of research has shifted to forecasting changes, whereas in the past the focus had been on merely describing and diagnosing research trends, such as surveillance and monitoring. This study also demonstrates that in recent years, there has been an expansion in analysis in linkage with other social Big Data sources, as researchers attempt to overcome the limitations of using only search information. Our study will provide various insights for researchers who utilize Google Trends as well as researchers who rely on various other sources of Big Data in their efforts to compare research trends and identify new areas for research.}
