We describe in\ndetail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau\nsearch. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems,\nthere is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of\nsatisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make\ndetailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the\naverage gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score\nand average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by\nshowing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis.\nThis work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to\nimprove understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.",

         "As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning\nprocedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut\npredicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be\nlearned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning\nsystems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of\na space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to\ngenerate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and\nthen make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of\nlearning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to\nbe a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate\nthe difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually\ncaused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion,\nthe analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that\nlearning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be\nrestricted to purely declarative logic languages.",

         "Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically shipped with tokenizers that\ndeterministically encode text into so-called canonical token sequences, to\nwhich the LLMs assign probability values. One common assumption is that the\nprobability of a piece of text is the probability of its canonical token\nsequence. However, the tokenization of a string is not unique: e.g., the Llama2\ntokenizer encodes Tokens as [Tok,ens], but [Tok,en,s] also represents the same\ntext. In this paper, we study non-canonical tokenizations. We prove that, given\na string, it is computationally hard to find the most likely tokenization for\nan autoregressive LLM, as well as to compute the marginal probability over all\npossible tokenizations. We then show how the marginal is, in most cases,\nindistinguishable from the canonical probability. Surprisingly, we then\nempirically demonstrate the existence of a significant amount of signal hidden\nwithin tokenization space. Notably, by simply aggregating the probabilities of\nnon-canonical tokenizations, we achieve improvements across a range of LLM\nevaluation benchmarks for a variety of architectures, including transformers\nand state space models.",

         "Despite the success of conventional collaborative filtering (CF) approaches\nfor recommendation systems, they exhibit limitations in leveraging semantic\nknowledge within the textual attributes of users and items. Recent focus on the\napplication of large language models for recommendation (LLM4Rec) has\nhighlighted their capability for effective semantic knowledge capture. However,\nthese methods often overlook the collaborative signals in user behaviors. Some\nsimply instruct-tune a language model, while others directly inject the\nembeddings of a CF-based model, lacking a synergistic fusion of different\nmodalities. To address these issues, we propose a framework of Collaborative\nCross-modal Fusion with Large Language Models, termed CCF-LLM, for\nrecommendation. In this framework, we translate the user-item interactions into\na hybrid prompt to encode both semantic knowledge and collaborative signals,\nand then employ an attentive cross-modal fusion strategy to effectively fuse\nlatent embeddings of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nCCF-LLM outperforms existing methods by effectively utilizing semantic and\ncollaborative signals in the LLM4Rec context.",

Nonetheless, despite the\nadvances that have been made, adoption of these systems in clinical settings\nhas been slow. One issue is a lack of question-answering datasets which reflect\nthe real-world needs of health professionals. In this work, we present\nRealMedQA, a dataset of realistic clinical questions generated by humans and an\nLLM. We describe the process for generating and verifying the QA pairs and\nassess several QA models on BioASQ and RealMedQA to assess the relative\ndifficulty of matching answers to questions. We show that the LLM is more\ncost-efficient for generating \"ideal\" QA pairs. Additionally, we achieve a\nlower lexical similarity between questions and answers than BioASQ which\nprovides an additional challenge to the top two QA models, as per the results.\nWe release our code and our dataset publicly to encourage further research.",

Furthermore, the approach is being developed to\nidentify the premises and claims of those arguments, and to identify the\nrelationships between arguments including support and attack relationships. In\nthis paper, we assume that an argument map contains the premises and claims of\narguments, and support and attack relationships between them, that have been\nidentified by argument mining. So from a piece of text, we assume an argument\nmap is obtained automatically by natural language processing. However, to\nunderstand and to automatically analyse that argument map, it would be\ndesirable to instantiate that argument map with logical arguments. Once we have\nthe logical representation of the arguments in an argument map, we can use\nautomated reasoning to analyze the argumentation (e.g. check consistency of\npremises, check validity of claims, and check the labelling on each arc\ncorresponds with thw logical arguments). We address this need by using\nclassical logic for representing the explicit information in the text, and\nusing default logic for representing the implicit information in the text. In\norder to investigate our proposal, we consider some specific options for\ninstantiation.",

We investigate the impact of these biases on answer choice\npreferences in the Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding (MMLU) task. Our\nfindings reveal that differences in learned regularities across answer options\nare predictive of model preferences and mirror human test-taking strategies. To\naddress this issue, we introduce two novel methods: Counterfactual Prompting\nwith Chain of Thought (CoT) and Counterfactual Prompting with Agnostically\nPrimed CoT (APriCoT). We demonstrate that while Counterfactual Prompting with\nCoT alone is insufficient to mitigate bias, our novel Primed Counterfactual\nPrompting with CoT approach effectively reduces the influence of base-rate\nprobabilities while improving overall accuracy.
