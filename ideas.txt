Ideas for improvement

1. Look at more papers in the target research journal to understand the forecasting portion more thoroughly
2. Use a larger arXiv dataset (auto-scraped data is freely available on GitHub)
3. Implementing NLP techniques for actual paper content as provided in the dataset
4. Do I need to change the data/framework for forecasting? In other words, should I gather more predictors for the publication output or go for more of an investigative approach.
Two possible ways: Feature engineering with context and using NLP to construct additional predictors from text (shifting from the established categories to created ones, conceptual)
5. Integrating LLMs for the context / feature engineering portions, perhaps historical references

Major focuses of improvement: Forecasting techniques, feature engineering, project focus, data


Lew feedback:
- Propose multiple papers
- Graphics fine
- Ch1 Test sample/ proof of concept for NLP category labels than inherent labels, data collection dissertation
- Ch2 Methodology paper on how to manage the data and own labels
- Ch3 Documenting arXiv as a valuable data resource (exploration and discussion of the whole thing)
- Break it into segments
- Historical context ideas: Timeline of inventions, funding totals, market stock prices of companies with involved technologies, patents, industries, tracking money might be easiest
- 40-60 advisor grad
- MODULAR piece by piece
